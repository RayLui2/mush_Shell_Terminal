When running my program, use "make mush2", to remove object files, use
"make clean". My mush2 supports all commands, in interactive mode and
also when provided a file.

I did not get to sigint handling in interactive mode, so a CTRL C will
just print out, if you type a command after CTRL C, such as "ls", it 
still works. I do block and unblock sigints before forking and when a 
child is made.

It has been an awesome quarter Professor, I've learned so much, thank you!
